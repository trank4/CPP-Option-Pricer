After testing for the results of batches in FDM methods, I reached some conclusions:
Generally, when using FDM methods, we want to pay attention to N, the time dimensions or the number of steps that we do FDM,
The bigger N, the more accuracy we have compared to the exact method as we can observed below (N=9999 for batch1,2,3,
and N = 1,000,000 for batch 4, we will discuss this later)
For batch1, When S = 60, Exact Solution: P = 5.84628, FDM Solution: P = 5.842068283
For batch2, When S = 100, Exact Solution: P = 7.96557, FDM Solution: P = 7.950275271
For batch3, When S = 5, Exact Solution: P = 4.07326, FDM Solution: P = 4.071284536
For batch4, When S = 100, Exact Solution: P = 1.23750, FDM Solution: P = 1.195304255
From the results above, I can conclude that with a big enough N, FDM method provides a good enough accurate results
(up to 2 decimal place) compared to the exact solution. Now of course if N is not big enough, we will have some problem.
If we look at batch 1, N= J =200 excel file, we can find that the Option price starts oscillating as asset prices increases,
this is of course not true in reality. Same problem for batch 4 (J= 200, N = 10000). For this, N is obviously not big enough
that the calculation converges into 65535. This is merely a mathematical issue and not true in reality.
In short, FDM is efficient at estimating option price, but it needs a big enough steps of calculation.
